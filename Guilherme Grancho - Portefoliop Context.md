**Next.js** **Route** **Map**

> • **Home** **(** **/** **)** – Serves as a dynamic overview of
> Guilherme’s profile. Features a headline (*“Crafting* *digital*
> *solutions* *with* *code”*), a concise introduction, and possibly a
> spotlight “featured project.” The home page will highlight key
> strengths and recent work at a glance. *(SEO:* title tag “Guilherme

>
> • **About** **(** **/about** **)** – Provides a detailed background.
> Includes sections such as *Introduction* (extended bio), *Work*
> *Experience* (chronologically listing roles and achievements, possibly
> via a timeline or bullet points), *Studies* (education history and key
> academic credentials), and *Technical* *Skills* (a summary of

> category). An option to display an “avatar” or profile photo will
> personalize this page. *(SEO:* title “About – Guilherme Grancho”)\*.
>
> • **Projects** **(** **/work** **)** – Showcases Guilherme’s major
> projects in a structured way. Each project is presented as a “card” or
> entry with a title, brief description, and link to more details.
> Projects span personal ventures, research projects, and notable
> software applications. For depth, each project may

>
> • *Example* *sub-route:* /work/portfolio-website might describe the
> making of this portfolio itself. Similarly, /work/prometheus for the
> trading platform, etc., if separate pages are created for projects.
>
> • **Publications** – *(If* *implemented* *as* *a* *separate* *page*
> *or* *integrated* *into* *About:)* This section compiles research
> publications and preprints. It would list papers with titles, venues,
> dates, and links to the full text (DOI, arXiv, or SSRN). This allows
> academic visitors to quickly find **Guilherme’s** **scholarly**
> **work**. *(Could* *be* *an* *anchor* *on* *About* *or* *a* *page*
> *like* */publications* *with* *title* *“Research”* *depending* *on*
> *design.)*
>
> • **Blog** **(** **/blog** **)** – *(Optional,* *currently* *planned*
> *as* *a* *placeholder)* A space for writing about development,
> technology, or insights from projects. If activated, blog posts
> (written in Markdown/MDX) would appear here in reverse chronological
> order. This could include tutorials (e.g., lessons learned from

> route in the current structure, but contact info is prominently
> provided (email link, LinkedIn, maybe a calendar link for scheduling).
> The **footer** of each page will list social links (GitHub, LinkedIn,

*Note:* The site uses a **single-page** **application** style for some
sections, with smooth scrolling and dynamic content loading. Navigation
links (Home, About, Projects, Blog, etc.) are available in a header
menu. The “audience toggle” might be implemented via a simple switch on
the home or about page that swaps out certain text blocks (as provided
in the Audience Messaging section) without needing separate routes.

**Design** **&** **SEO** **Considerations**

> • **Branding** **&** **Aesthetics:** The portfolio adopts a *clean,*
> *modern* *design* with subtle animations – aligning with Guilherme’s
> tone of being competent and “subtly ambitious.” The color scheme will
> likely be minimalist (e.g. whites/grays or a dark mode) with accent
> colors sparingly used to highlight key elements (possibly an Imperial
> blue or eco-friendly green to nod to his afiliations). A professional
> headshot and a custom logo/monogram may be included for personal
> branding. Overall, the design should convey **professionalism**
> **and** **approachability**, ensuring readability (short paragraphs,
> clear headings) as a priority.
>
> • **Responsive** **and** **Dynamic** **UI:** Built on Next.js with a
> React component library (the template references an @once-ui-system ),
> the site is fully responsive and optimized for performance. It uses
> modern front-end tech (Tailwind CSS, perhaps Framer Motion for
> animations
> [41](https://github.com/guilhermegranchopro/Eco-AI.ly#:~:text=) ) to
> create an engaging yet fast experience. All interactive elements (like
> toggles, filters, or a light/dark theme switch) are implemented
> accessibly and tested across devices.
>
> • **SEO** **Meta** **Tags:** Every page includes descriptive meta
> tags. The homepage’s \<meta name="description"\>
> conciselysummarizesGuilherme’sprofile(e.g.
> *“MachineLearningresearcher*
>
> 8
>
> *and* *software* *developer* *with* *experience* *in* *AI,* *finance,*
> *and* *sustainability.* *Portfolio* *of* *projects,*
> *publications,andachievements.”*).Eachsubpage(About,Projects,etc.)hasitsownrelevantdescription
> extending the keywords (e.g. About page highlights education and
> skills; Projects page mentions AI, web development, startup projects).
> The site title format combines his name and page section (as seen in

> [43](https://github.com/guilhermegranchopro/Guilherme-Grancho-Portfolio/blob/8abc45fcebccd8d3dd28aec4f53c752ec4668b4d/portfolio/src/resources/content.js#L68-L76)
> ). Open Graph (og:) tags and Twitter Card tags are set up for social
> sharing – for example, sharing the site will show his name, a brief
> tagline, and a thumbnail (perhaps his profile photo or a project
> montage). Search engines are also aided by the structured content:
> listings of skills and roles in the About page are in plain text for
> indexing.
>
> • **Performance** **&** **Accessibility:** Next.js ensures server-side
> rendering for SEO, and code-splitting for performance. Images are
> optimized (likely using Next/Image) – including lazy loading and
> responsive sizing. All images include **alt** **text** describing
> content (important for accessibility and SEO). The site uses semantic
> HTML5 elements and ARIA labels where appropriate, aiming for a high
> Lighthouse accessibility score.
>
> •
> **Analytics&Tracking:**Ifanalyticsareused(e.g.GoogleAnalyticsorplausible.io),theyareincludedin
> compliance with privacy norms (cookie consent if required under EU
> law, etc.). The design avoids intrusive pop-ups or distractions – the
> focus remains on content.
>
> • **Content** **Strategy:** Emphasis is on **high-signal** **content**
> – all claims are supported by data or outcomes (publications, metrics)
> to boost credibility. The writing style is UK English (per Guilherme’s
> preference), checked for clarity and professional tone. Keywords
> reflecting his expertise (e.g. *machine* *learning,* *deep*
> *learning,* *full-stack* *development,* *quantitative* *finance,*
> *sustainability* *AI*) are naturally woven into the content to improve
> search visibility for those terms. However, keyword stufing is
> avoided; authenticity and readability come first.

**Privacy** **&** **Data** **Use**

This portfolio is careful to respect privacy and data protection
principles:

> • **Personal** **Data** **Shared:** The site shares Guilherme’s
> professional background and contact information (email, LinkedIn)
> intentionally. No sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, phone
> number, date of birth) is displayed publicly. Any personal identifiers
> included (like names of collaborators or co-founders) are limited to
> those already public (such as co-authors on papers or business
> partners mentioned on LinkedIn/GitHub) and are used with respect. For
> example, publication authorship and startup co-founder names are part
> of public records and thus are appropriate to mention.
>
> • **Consent** **&** **Source** **of** **Information:** All information
> presented is either *publicly* *available* or *first-party* *data*
> provided by Guilherme. Education and work details come from his CV and
> LinkedIn (which he has openly shared); project details come from his
> public GitHub repositories and published papers. Where metrics or
> claims are drawn from personal records (e.g. Tap2Net sales figures),
> it is clearly indicated as such and was provided by Guilherme for use
> in this context. The site avoids disclosing any confidential details
> from employers or collaborators that are not already public.
>
> 9
>
> •
> **CookiesandTracking:**Theportfolioitselfisstaticanddoesnotusecookiesexceptpotentiallyforan
> analytics tool (if implemented). Any analytics will be GDPR-compliant,
> anonymizing IPs and respecting “Do Not Track” signals. There is no
> collection of user input data except if a visitor actively contacts
> Guilherme (e.g. via an email link or a contact form, in which case the
> data goes directly to him and is not stored on the site).
>
> • **Third-Party** **Content:** Embedded content (like images or PDFs)
> are either hosted locally or on trusted platforms (GitHub, arXiv,
> etc.). External links (to papers, GitHub, LinkedIn) are provided for
> reference and direct the user to those external sites – users should
> refer to those sites’ privacy policies as needed. The portfolio does
> not incorporate any external user tracking scripts beyond basic
> analytics.
>
> • **Updates** **and** **Accuracy:** Guilherme is committed to keeping
> the content accurate and up-to-date. If any project or role changes,
> the site will be updated promptly to reflect that (ensuring that
> outdated information isn’t misleading). By controlling his own site,
> he ensures that data is presented in the way he is comfortable with,
> balancing transparency about his achievements with respect for privacy
> and professional confidentiality where required (e.g., not disclosing
> proprietary code or sensitive research details not yet published).

**Maintenance** **Checklist**

To keep this portfolio accurate and effective, the following should be
reviewed and updated regularly:

> • **Education** **Status:** Update the Imperial College London MSc
> status. (e.g. Once commenced in 09/2025, change phrasing from “will
> further expand next year” to present tense; after graduation in
> 10/2026, mark the MSc as completed and add any distinctions or thesis
> info.)
>
> • **Work** **&** **Projects:** Add new roles or projects promptly. For
> example, if Guilherme undertakes a **PhD** **or** **a** **new**
> **job** post-MSc, create a new entry in About/Timeline and possibly a
> project page if research is significant. Similarly, if Tap2Net or
> other older projects phase out, consider moving them under an
> “Archive” or de-emphasizing to keep the main portfolio current.
>
> • **Publications:** Update the Publications section with any newly
> published papers. (E.g. add the *Integrating* *Financial* *Torque*
> *Hypothesis...* paper once it’s published, with venue and date. Add
> journal publications or thesis if applicable.) Also update metrics if
> noteworthy (like “SSRN downloads” if it grows significantly or if a
> paper wins an award).
>
> • **Metrics** **and** **Achievements:** Refresh key metrics annually.
> For instance, if the Eco AI.ly platform expands its accuracy or user
> base, or if GitHub project stars count increases, update those figures
> in highlights. Ensure all “current” metrics (e.g. accuracy, downloads,
> sales) are still accurate – either by verifying sources or adjusting
> language to “~X” or “over Y” as appropriate.
>
> • **Timeline** **and** **Dates:** Every few months, check that the
> Timeline Summary reflects the present. Move any ongoing roles that
> have ended into a past tense context with their end date. Add major
> recent events (e.g. “June 2026: Graduated MSc with Merit”, “2026–2027:
> Software Engineer at Company X”) as they happen. Remove or consolidate
> older items if the timeline becomes too unwieldy, focusing on the most
> relevant 5–7 year window for brevity.
>
> • **Audience** **Toggle** **Content:** Re-evaluate the
> audience-specific messages. As Guilherme’s career focus shifts (e.g.
> more towards industry or academia), the tone and emphasis might need
> tweaking. Ensure the CTAs are still valid (for example, if the email
> or LinkedIn changes, or if a new preferred contact method emerges).
>
> • **SEO** **&** **Technical:** Periodically test site performance and
> fix any broken links (especially to external sources like papers or
> GitHub repos that may move). Update the SEO meta descriptions if
> Guilherme’s focus areas evolve (e.g. add “PhD candidate” if
> applicable, or new skill keywords if he
>
> 11
>
> diversifies). Also, refresh the Open Graph image if a more current
> profile picture or signature project image is available.
>
> • **Design** **Refresh:** While the design should remain relatively
> stable, consider a refresh every 1–2 years to keep the look modern.
> This could include updating the avatar photo, adding a short video or
> new graphics from recent projects, or incorporating testimonials if
> available (e.g. a quote from a professor or manager – ensure
> permission and appropriateness before adding).
>
> • **Privacy** **&** **Content** **Audit:** Ensure any additions of
> content continue to respect privacy guidelines. If posting a new blog
> or project that involves others (team members, clients), double-check
> that no confidential details are included and that credit is given
> where due. Remove personal data that becomes irrelevant over time (for
> instance, if a phone number was added for some reason, or an old
> email).
>
> • **Backup** **&** **Version** **Control:** Keep the content
> (especially data in the PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT) version-controlled (Git)
> and backed up. Before major edits, save a copy of the current state.
> This not only preserves history but also allows reverting if needed.

By following this checklist, the portfolio will remain a **living**
**document** that accurately represents Guilherme’s professional journey
and capabilities. Regular maintenance ensures that visitors – whether
recruiters, colleagues, or collaborators – always see up-to-date
information and that Guilherme’s personal brand continues to shine
through authentically.
