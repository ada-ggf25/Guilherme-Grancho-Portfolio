# Style Refinements - Reference Alignment

## Overview
Based on analysis of Margarida Oliveira's portfolio (https://www.margaridaoliveira.com/), the following refinements were made to better align with the reference style:

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Project Layout Restructure
- **Before**: Large card-based layout with images and complex grid
- **After**: Clean, left-aligned layout matching the reference exactly
- Simplified to focus on content hierarchy: Category → Project Name → Role/Timeline → Description → Tech Stack

### 2. Typography and Spacing
- **Hero Section**: Updated to "Welcome to Guilherme Grancho's Software Lab" format
- **Subtitle**: Changed to "a full-stack developer with an eye for design" (matching reference tone)
- **Project Titles**: Larger, bolder typography (text-4xl to text-5xl)
- **Consistent spacing**: 32-unit margins between sections for better rhythm

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **Status Dots**: Added animated colored dots next to project titles (green, blue, purple)
- **Project Status Tags**: Positioned consistently in top-right corner
- **Elegant Separators**: Added subtle gradient separators between projects

### 4. Navigation Simplification
- **Removed**: Home and About navigation items (following reference pattern)
- **Kept**: Only Work and Contact navigation for cleaner focus
- **Maintained**: Theme toggle integration and smooth scrolling

### 5. Tech Stack Presentation
- **Replaced**: Emoji icons with clean geometric indicators
- **Improved**: Consistent color coding per project (blue, emerald, purple)
- **Layout**: Horizontal flow with proper spacing and typography

### 6. Content Structure
- **Role Information**: Added specific roles (Lead Developer, Core Contributor, Lead UI/UX Developer)
- **Timeline**: Added project duration periods (23-24, 22-24, 24-25)
- **Descriptions**: Refined to match the professional, concise tone of the reference

## Design Philosophy Alignment

### Minimalism
- Removed unnecessary visual clutter
- Focused on typography and white space
- Clean, geometric indicators instead of complex graphics

### Professional Tone
- Consistent "Software Lab" branding approach
- Professional role descriptions and timelines
- Clean, modern tech stack presentation

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear section categorization (uppercase labels)
- Prominent project titles with status indicators
- Consistent spacing and typography scales

## Technical Implementation
- Maintained all existing animations and effects
- Preserved dark/light theme functionality
- Kept responsive design principles
- Removed unused components (GlowingCard) for cleaner codebase

## Result
The portfolio now closely matches the reference style while maintaining its unique personality and technical sophistication. The layout is cleaner, more professional, and follows the exact patterns observed in Margarida's successful portfolio design.
