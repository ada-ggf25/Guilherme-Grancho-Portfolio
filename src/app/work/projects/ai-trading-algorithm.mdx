## Overview

Prometheus is an open-source quantitative trading platform that integrates live market data (Alpaca API) with machine learning models for strategy research. The platform features a full-stack Streamlit app for interactive data visualization and model backtesting, with a focus on rigorous research and software craftsmanship.

## Key Features

- **Financial Torque Hypothesis**: Implemented an LSTM-based "Financial Torque" model that predicted intraday stock trends with 87% accuracy, later published as an academic preprint.
- **Live Market Data Integration**: Real-time data feeds from Alpaca Markets API with support for multiple data sources and comprehensive market analysis.
- **Interactive Backtesting**: Full-stack Streamlit application for interactive data visualization, model backtesting, and strategy development.
- **Research-Grade Implementation**: Clean API design, modular notebooks, and comprehensive documentation for academic and industry use.
- **Extended Trading Hours**: Experiments showed that including full-session trading data (pre-market + after-hours) improved prediction accuracy by 15% over regular hours only.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core development language with pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data analysis
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for LSTM neural network development
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application for data visualization and backtesting
- **Alpaca Markets API**: Real-time and historical market data integration
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis for financial time series
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Research documentation and model development

## Research Results

- **Prediction Accuracy**: 87% accuracy in predicting stock price direction over 3-hour horizons
- **Extended Hours Impact**: 15% improvement in predictive accuracy when including pre-market and after-hours data
- **Academic Publication**: Results published as "The Financial Torque Hypothesis" on SSRN with over 100 downloads
- **Model Performance**: LSTM-based approach significantly outperformed traditional technical analysis methods

## Key Achievement

The project's crowning achievement was the development and validation of the Financial Torque Hypothesis, a novel market indicator that uses LSTM neural networks to predict short-term stock price movements. This work represents a significant contribution to quantitative finance research and has garnered international interest from the finance research community.

## Impact

This project demonstrates the potential of combining rigorous academic research with practical software development. The open-source nature of Prometheus allows other researchers and practitioners to build upon the work, while the published research contributes to the broader understanding of machine learning applications in finance.

## Future Development

- Integration of additional machine learning architectures and ensemble methods
- Expansion to multiple asset classes and international markets
- Development of real-time trading capabilities with proper risk management
- Collaboration with academic institutions for further research validation
